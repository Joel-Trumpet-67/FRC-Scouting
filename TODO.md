## 🔁 Before Each Event (checklist)

- [ ] Open `config/event-config.js`
- [ ] Change `EVENT_CODE` to the new event (e.g. `"2026miket"`)
- [ ] Confirm `TBA_KEY` is still valid (check at thebluealliance.com/account)
- [ ] Replace `assets/images/YEAR/field_image.png` with the current season's field image
- [ ] Update `FIELD_LABELS` in `js/match.js` if game fields changed
- [ ] Update `EFS_LABELS` / `DTA_LABELS` in `js/match.js` for new endgame options
- [ ] Update pre-comp field labels in `js/precomp.js` if capability questions change
- [ ] Update pre-comp label maps in `js/dashboard.js` (`PC_PAL`, `PC_PEC`, etc.)
- [ ] Update the team detail modal field list in `js/dashboard.js` `openTeamModal()`
- [ ] Push to GitHub → GitHub Pages auto-deploys

**Pre-event (Pre-Comp workflow):**
- [ ] Share the event's TBA code and sync code with your scouting team
- [ ] Have each scout open `precomp.html` and fill out teams from reveal videos
- [ ] If attending a week-0 or pit day, update entries with live pit visit data
- [ ] Check the Pre-Comp tab in `dashboard.html` to review your team assessments

## 🚀 High Priority (do before next season)

### Add DEFAULT_SYNC_CODE to config
- Add `const DEFAULT_SYNC_CODE = "TEAM1234";` to `config/event-config.js`
- In `js/match.js` `initFirebase()`, use it as a fallback if localStorage is empty
- Scouts won't need to type the code in — just open and go
- **File to edit:** `config/event-config.js`, `js/match.js`

### Pre-comp: overwrite warning
- When re-scouting a team that already has a pre-comp entry, show a confirmation prompt
- Currently it silently overwrites — a prompt prevents accidental data loss
- **File to edit:** `js/precomp.js` → `submitData()` (check if precompRef.child(team) exists first)

### Pre-comp: scouted count in banner
- Show how many teams have been pre-scouted in the banner: "Sync: TEAM1234 — 8 teams scouted"
- Listen on `precompRef` and count keys, then update the banner text
- **File to edit:** `js/precomp.js` → `applyCode()` — add a `.on('value')` listener

### Pre-comp: validation before swipe
- Block leaving the Team Info page until Scouter + Team # are filled
- Same idea as the match.js validation TODO
- **File to edit:** `js/precomp.js` → `swipePage()`

### Pre-comp: export CSV
- Add an "Export Pre-Comp CSV" button on the dashboard's Pre-Comp tab
- Exports all precompData rows as a CSV
- **File to edit:** `js/dashboard.js` → add `exportPrecompCSV()` next to `exportCSV()`

### Pre-comp: merge tier column into match data table
- Add an "Expected Tier" column to the main match data table pulled from precompData
- Lets coaches see expected vs actual side by side during alliance selection
- **File to edit:** `js/dashboard.js` → `renderTable()`, `dashboard.html` → thead

### Per-page validation before swipe
- Block advancing from Pre-Match until Scouter initials + Match # are filled
- Show a brief error message instead of silently allowing blank data through
- **File to edit:** `js/match.js` → `swipePage()` function

---

## 📋 Medium Priority

### Offline queue (submit when reconnected)
- If Firebase is unreachable at submit time, save the entry to `localStorage`
- On next Firebase connect, push the queued entries and clear the queue
- Prevents data loss at venues with spotty wifi
- **File to edit:** `js/match.js` → `submitData()`, `initFirebase()`

### Export pick list
- Add an "Export Pick List" button in `dashboard.html`
- Exports team number, scouted avg, SB EPA, and pick status as CSV
- **File to edit:** `js/dashboard.js` → add `exportPicklist()` next to `exportCSV()`

### Persist sort preference
- Save `sortCol` + `sortDir` to `localStorage` in `sortBy()`
- Restore them on page load so sort survives refresh during alliance selection
- **File to edit:** `js/dashboard.js` → `sortBy()`, boot section

### 3-state pick list toggle (manual overrated)
- Current cycle: Available → Do Not Pick → Available
- New cycle: Available → Overrated → Do Not Pick → Available
- Lets coaches manually mark a team as overrated even without SB data
- **File to edit:** `js/dashboard.js` → `toggleStatus()`

---

## 💡 Nice to Have (future season)

### Coach notes on teams
- Add a text area in the team detail modal
- Saves to Firebase: `sessions/{code}/notes/{team}`
- Visible to all coaches connected to the same sync code

### Match sparkline in team modal
- Small inline chart in the team detail modal showing scoring trend by match
- Helps spot sandbagging or robots that improve/decline over the day
- Could use a simple `<canvas>` or a tiny charting library

### Alliance selection simulator
- Pick 3 alliances, calculate combined EPA, highlight pick conflicts
- Useful during alliance selection at champs/districts

### Light mode / print mode
- Dashboard dark theme is hard to read outdoors or under bright lights
- Add a CSS toggle or `@media print` styles so coaches can print rankings

## ✅ Completed

- Firebase Realtime Database sync via shared room code
- TBA auto-fill (team numbers from live match schedule)
- Match preview grid showing all 6 positions (R1–R3 / B1–B3)
- Robot position + scouter initials persist after each submit
- Hub Capacity counter in Teleop
- GitHub Pages hosting (no server needed)
- Dashboard with Statbotics EPA columns + scouted averages
- Sortable table (click any column header)
- Team detail modal with all scouting entries
- Overrated auto-flagging (SB rank vs. scouted percentile)
- Picklist synced live across all connected devices
- Export CSV
- Refactored into clean folder structure (config/, js/, css/, assets/)
- EVENT_CODE + TBA_KEY extracted to config/event-config.js
- Pre-comp scouting form (precomp.html + js/precomp.js)
- Dashboard Pre-Comp tab showing capability assessments by tier
- TBA team roster autocomplete in precomp.html (works before schedule is posted)
